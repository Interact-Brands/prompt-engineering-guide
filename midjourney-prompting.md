    What is Prompt Engineering?
  </summary>
    Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs). Prompt crafting isn't just about constructing clever queries; it helps improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks. It's the art of forging a relationship with these linguistic giants, where understanding their capabilities and limitations is just the beginning.

<h1 id=parameters align="center">Parameters</h1>


### Basic Parameters

- `--aspect` or `--ar`: Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

### Aspect Ratios

- `--aspect` or `--ar`: Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

### Chaos

- `--chaos <number 0â€“100>`: Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

### Fast Mode

- `--fast`: Override your current setting and run a single job using Fast Mode.

### Image Weight

- `--iw <0â€“2>`: Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is 1.

### Negative Prompting

- `--no`: Negative prompting, `--no plants` would try to remove plants from the image.

### Quality

- `--quality <.25, .5, or 1>`, or `--q <.25, .5, or 1>`: How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values use more GPU minutes; lower values use less.

### Relax Mode

- `--relax`: Override your current setting and run a single job using Relax Mode.

### Repeat Jobs

- `--repeat <1â€“40>`, or `--r <1â€“40>`: Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. `--repeat` is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.

### Seed Number

- `--seed <integer between 0â€“4294967295>`: The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the `--seed` or `--sameseed` parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

### Stop Parameter

- `--stop <integer between 10â€“100>`: Use the `--stop` parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

### Style Options

- `--style <raw>`: Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 5.1 and 5.2.
- `--style <4a, 4b, or 4c>`: Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4.
- `--style <cute, expressive, original, or scenic>`: Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5.

### Stylize Parameter

- `--stylize <number>`, or `--s <number>`: Parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

### Tile Images

- `--tile`: Parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns.

### Turbo Mode

- `--Turbo`: Override your current setting and run a single job using Turbo Mode.

### Weird Aesthetics

- `--Weird <number 0â€“3000>`: Explore unusual aesthetics with the experimental `--weird` parameter.

<h1 id=tips align="center">Quick Tips</h1>

## ðŸŽ¯ Be Precise
The more specific your prompt, the better. Instead of a generic "a cat," consider specifying "a photorealistic portrait of a tabby cat with vibrant green eyes."

## ðŸ”‘ Utilize Relevant Keywords
Incorporate keywords that provide Midjourney with a clear understanding of your desired image. Use words like "cat," "feline," "whiskers," and "paws" if you're looking for a cat image.

## âœ¨ Enhance with Descriptive Words
Infuse your prompt with depth and precision by using adjectives and adverbs. Request "a photorealistic portrait of a tabby cat with striking green eyes, perched on a sunlit windowsill."

## ðŸ“· Offer Visual References
Whenever possible, provide examples to help Midjourney grasp your expectations. Include a reference image link like this: "I'd like a photorealistic portrait of a tabby cat resembling this [link to an image of a tabby cat]."

## ðŸ§ª Experiment Freely
Don't hesitate to explore various prompts. Experimentation is key to honing your ability to create effective prompts. The more you experiment, the more proficient you'll become.

## ðŸŽ¨ Align Keywords with Desired Style
If you desire an image in a specific artistic style, make sure your keywords reflect that style. For instance, if you want Midjourney to produce an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh, include keywords like "van gogh" and "impressionism" to convey your intent clearly.

In these types of prompts, you simply describe the primary subject(s) of the image, and Midjourney generates the image based on its interpretation. The "hyperrealistic" command is also particularly useful for making fantastical or animated characters appear real.
