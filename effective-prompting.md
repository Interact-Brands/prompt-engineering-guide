    What is Prompt Engineering?
  </summary>
    Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs). Prompt crafting isn't just about constructing clever queries; it helps improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks. It's the art of forging a relationship with these linguistic giants, where understanding their capabilities and limitations is just the beginning.

**Zero-Shot prompting:** Zero-shot prompting is a method in artificial intelligence where a language model is given a task or question without any specific training examples. Instead, it uses its pre-existing knowledge and the provided instructions to generate a response or perform the task. It's a way to make AI models more versatile and adaptable to different tasks without extensive training.

>Zero-shot prompting is like asking a very smart friend a question without giving them any background information or examples. They rely on their general knowledge and the way you phrase the question to give you an answer. It's a way for AI to answer questions or do tasks it hasn't been specifically trained for. For example, you might ask, "What are the main ingredients in pizza?" and the AI can answer without having seen a pizza recipe before.
